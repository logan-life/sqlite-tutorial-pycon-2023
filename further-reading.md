## Fun demos

I post a lot of Datasette projects on my blog. Some of my recent favourites:

- [Exploring the training data behind Stable Diffusion](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/5/laion-aesthetics-weeknotes/) describes how I built [laion-aesthetic.datasette.io](https://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/images) to explore 12m training images used for Stable Diffusion.
- [Analyzing ScotRail audio announcements with Datasetteâ€”from prototype to production](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Aug/21/scotrail/) explains the [scotrail.datasette.io](https://scotrail.datasette.io/) project.
- [I built a ChatGPT plugin to answer questions about data hosted in Datasette](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/24/datasette-chatgpt-plugin/) is one of my earlier explorations at the intersection of LLM AI and Datasette.

## SpatiaLite
