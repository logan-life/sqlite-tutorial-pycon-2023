## What you'll need: Python 3

For the first part of this tutorial, you'll need a Python 3 interpreter with the `sqlite3` standard library module available.

You can run this on your own computer, or use a browser-based environment.

https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html will work for a purely browser-based (WebAssembly) environment.

For the second part, you'll also need the ability to `pip install` Python packages. Python 3 on your own laptop (maybe in a fresh virtual environment) is a good option here. You could also use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyter) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyter.org/try) or your online notebook solution of choice.

I'll be working through the tutorial using GitHub Codespaces, using https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyter
